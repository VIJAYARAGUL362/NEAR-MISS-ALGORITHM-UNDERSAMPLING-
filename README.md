# NearMiss Undersampling Example

This repository demonstrates the use of the NearMiss undersampling technique to address class imbalance in a dataset. It includes data visualization and implementation of NearMiss versions 1, 2, and 3. This project is intended to serve as a learning resource and a template for future projects dealing with imbalanced datasets.

## Introduction

Class imbalance is a common problem in machine learning, where one class has significantly more samples than another. This can lead to biased models that perform poorly on the minority class. Undersampling techniques, such as NearMiss, aim to balance the dataset by removing samples from the majority class. This repository provides a practical example of applying NearMiss to a sample dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset is a simple dictionary containing animal information:

* **ANIMAL:** Binary classification (0 and 1, representing different animal types, e.g., dog and cat).
* **HEIGHT:** Height of the animal.
* **WEIGHT:** Weight of the animal.

This dataset is converted into a pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation.

## Libraries Used

* **pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **numpy:** For numerical operations.
* **matplotlib.pyplot:** For creating basic visualizations.
* **seaborn:** For enhanced statistical data visualization.
* **collections.Counter:** For counting the frequency of items.
* **imblearn:** For implementing NearMiss undersampling.

## Visualization

The repository includes the following visualizations:

* **Pie Chart:** Shows the distribution of the 'ANIMAL' classes, highlighting the class imbalance.
* **Scatter Plot:** Visualizes the relationship between 'HEIGHT' and 'WEIGHT', with different colors representing different animal classes. This helps understand the data distribution and potential patterns.

## NearMiss Undersampling

NearMiss is an undersampling technique that aims to balance the dataset by removing samples from the majority class based on their distance to the nearest samples in the minority class.

The repository demonstrates the use of three versions of NearMiss:

* **NearMiss-1:** Selects samples from the majority class whose average distance to the k nearest samples of the minority class is smallest.
* **NearMiss-2:** Selects samples from the majority class whose average distance to the k farthest samples of the minority class is smallest.
* **NearMiss-3:** Selects a given number of the nearest majority class examples for every minority class example.

The `fit_resample` method from `imblearn` is used to apply NearMiss and obtain the resampled data.

## Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    cd [repository directory]
    ```

2.  **Install the required libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn imbalanced-learn
    ```

3.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script:**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook NearMiss_Example.ipynb #Or python your_script.py
    ```

4.  **Observe the visualizations and the effects of NearMiss undersampling.**

5.  **Adapt the code for your imbalanced datasets.**

## Future Improvements

* Implement other undersampling and oversampling techniques for comparison.
* Evaluate the performance of machine learning models trained on the original and resampled datasets.
* Add more detailed explanations and comments to the code.
* Create a more complex or real world dataset.
* Add a test script.
